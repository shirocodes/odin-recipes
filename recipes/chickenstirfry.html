    <p>This chicken stir-fry recipe is packed with veggies and is quick and 
    easy to prepare. Try adding some bean sprouts, french beans, or any other
    of your preferred veggies.</p>
    <p>The good thing about this stew is that it can be served with any pasta, 
    rice, or noodles.</p>

    <h2> <strong>How to Make Chicken Stir-Fry</strong> </h2>
    <p>Chicken breasts an chicken thighs both work well for stir fries. Just 
    make sure the pieces are relatively small and thin. Plus, they should be 
    about the same size so the chicken cooks evenly.
    </p>

    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups brown recipe</li>
        <li>2/3 cup soy source</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 head broccoli, broken into florets</li>
        <li>1 onion, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
        <li>1 can sliced chestnuts, drained</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. 
    Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, 
    and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a
    medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, 
    garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover
    and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over 
    medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, 
    and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. 
    Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or 
    skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, 
    and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in 
    vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir 
    until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are 
    tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</p>
