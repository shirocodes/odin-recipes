    <p><em>Serves: 4 People</em></p>
    <p><em>Cooking time: 1.5 hours</em></p>
    <p>Every time I whip up this curry, people can't help but ask,
    "What did you put in this magic?!" So, I figured it's time to 
    finally write it down and add it to my trusty recipe stash.
    This one's perfect for cranking up the spice level—if you're 
    feeling bold! But if you'd rather keep things mellow, just 
    throw in a splash of coconut cream at the end. And yeah, 
    the ingredient list may look <em>super long</em>, but trust me, it's 
    totally <em>worth it</em>. This curry will blow your socks right off!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750g lamb, I prefer shoulder on the bone, cut into overly large 
        chunks (You can always get your butcher to help with this) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thick plain yoghurt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, I like rapeseed</li>
        <li>6 cloves, 2 bay leaves, 3 fresh cardamon pods, and 1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds</li>
        <li>2 onions and cloves garlic (chop them well)</li>
        <li>4 finely sliced green chillies</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of chilli powder (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt to taste</li>
        <li>250g well-diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons of fresh chopped coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Firstly marinade the lamb. In a large bowl mix together the yogurt 
        and turmeric. Add the lamb and rub all over massaging it into the meat. 
        Cover and refrigerate overnight (if you have time).</li>
        <li>Remove the lamb from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature 
        while you start the masala. Gently heat the vegetable oil in a large pan 
        and add the fenugreek seeds, cloves, green cardamom, bay leaves, cinnamon 
        stick and dried red chillies.</li>
        <li>n a pestle & mortar slightly grind the cumin seeds, coriander seeds and 
        fennel seeds. </li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the masala in the pan and once they start sizzling add 
        the coarsely crushed seeds.</li>
        <li>Once they begin to sizzle add the onions. Stir well and allow to cook 
        until they have turned soft and are starting to change colour to light 
        golden brown. </li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger and all the chillies and allow to cook for a 
        further minute. </li>
        <li>Stir in the coriander powder, fennel powder and chilli powder (if using) 
        and add a few tablespoons of water to prevent the spices from burning.</li>
        <li>Allow the masala to cook, leaving the spices to release their essential 
        oils and aromas. This will take a few minutes and you will start to see a 
        little oil rising to the surface. Stir often until it looks like all 
        the masala has released most of its oils, adding a little more water 
        if it starts to stick.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated lamb.</li>
        <li>Stir well and add the chopped tomatoes and salt.</li>
        <li>Top with enough water so it is just below the lamb. Stir well and 
        bring to a simmer. Cover and allow to cook for at least 30 minutes. 
        Every 10 minutes or so, stir the masala to ensure nothing is sticking 
        to the base of the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the essential oils have risen to the surface, stir through the 
        coriander.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt if you need to.</li>
        <li>Serve with more fresh coriander sprinkled on top </li>
        
        <p><strong>Cooking Tip:</strong><em> The longer the masala cooks with the lamb, 
        the better, and because you are using lamb shoulder it will remain tender 
        even if you cook it for longer than 30 minutes.</em></p>
    </ol>
    <p> Pair this delicious lamb curry with warm, buttery naan for the ultimate 
    comfort meal! And hey, if you're feeling extra creamy, don't forget to stir
    in a splash of coconut milk—it's optional but oh-so-good! Trust me, your 
    taste buds will be doing a happy dance! <strong>Bon Appétit</strong></p>
